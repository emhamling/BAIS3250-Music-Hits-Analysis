## Overview

This project explores the audio characteristics that make a song more likely to chart in the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. We combine web-scraped Billboard data and a Spotify audio features dataset from Kaggle to conduct exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and simple machine learning.
