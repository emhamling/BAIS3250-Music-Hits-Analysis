## Overview

This project explores the audio characteristics that make a song more likely to chart in the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. We combine web-scraped Billboard data and a Spotify audio features dataset from Kaggle to conduct exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and simple machine learning. We combined scraping, data wrangling, descriptive analysis, hypothesis testing, and machine learning to explore trends and build predictive models.
