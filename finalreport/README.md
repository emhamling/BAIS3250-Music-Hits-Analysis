## Key Findings

- **Top 10 Billboard songs** had higher average valence and danceability than other songs.
- Spotify **popularity** had a strong negative correlation with `daily_rank` (lower = better).
- **Random Forest Regression** outperformed linear models with an R² ≈ 0.016 and MSE ≈ 196.
- **Valence**, **tempo**, and **popularity** were the most important predictive features.
- Attempted **classification models**, but results were inconsistent and harder to interpret.
